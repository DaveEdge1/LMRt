LMR Turbo (LMRt)
=====================================


A lightweight, packaged version of the [Last Millennium Reanalysia (LMR)](https://github.com/modons/LMR) framework,
inspired by LMR_lite.py originated by Professor Hakim (Univ. of Washington).
Ultimately, it aims to provide following features:

+ Greater flexibility
    + Easy installation
    + Easy importing and usage in Jupyter notebooks (or scripts)
    + No assumption of a fixed folder structure; just feed the correct files to functions
    + Easy setup for different priors, proxies, and Proxy System Models (PSMs) included in [PRYSM API](https://github.com/fzhu2e/prysm-api)
+ Faster speed
    + Easy parallel computing with multiprocessing and other techniques
+ Leveraging the power of Machine Learning (added in v0.6.0)
